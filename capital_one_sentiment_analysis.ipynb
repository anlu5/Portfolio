Please note this was for an OUTGOING transfer noted as \" XXXX PAYMENT TO ... XXXX '' in my account. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I called the bank to inquire as to the transfer. I requested a trace number and the representative told me they didn't have one. I was told a claim would be started to find out where the money was ( claim # ending in XXXX ). In the meantime, she said they would refund my account. I was told this would take up to 10 business days. I asked for a trace number but they could not provide one. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX they sent a letter. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I received said letter which said my claim was denied because their \" records didn't show an INCOMING deposit from XXXX PAYMENT TO ... XXXX XXXX  They asked me to verify with the \" sender '' their XXXX digit trace number. \\n\\non XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX pm I spoke with a Capital One rep ( XXXX ID # XXXX ) who did not seem to understand we were referring t an OUTgoing transfer rather than incoming. She finally seemed to understand the situation and said she would update the claim. I asked for a trace number but they could not provide one. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I called again to check on the claim. I spoke with multiple representatives who kept passing me from one department to another. All of them were still under the impression we were talking about an INCOMING transfer. \\n\\nFinally, I was transfered to XXXX in the claims department. XXXX refused to give me her employee ID #. XXXX said the info she had on file was : - XX/XX/XXXX case opened - XX/XX/XXXX case closed - XXXX XXXX case closed again? \\n- XXXX XXXX rebutal submitted after my phone call - XXXX XXXX case closed again, I was never informed. \\n\\nShe said the case was closed again on XX/XX/XXXX because they did not receive enough information. She said the missing information pertained to the trace number on the transaction. I asked again if she had a trace number ; she said no. I asked how I was supposed to provide a trace number for an OUTgoing transfer when they, the OUTgoing bank, did not have it to begin with. She was confused. \\n\\nAt XXXX pm ( one hour into the phone call ) she began opening a new claim ( new claim ending in # XXXX ). She said it would take 45 days to hear back on the new claim. I told her I did not want to wait that long given I have already waited 90 days for my XXXX XXXX dollars to be found. She said she could not expedite it so now I have to wait another month and a half for them to \" investigate '' what happened to the money.</td>\n",

       "0   On XX/XX/XXXX an ACH transfer from my business checking account at Capital One was sent out to make a payment to a vendor for {$5000.00} USD. The vendor never received the payment. Please note this was for an OUTGOING transfer noted as \" XXXX PAYMENT TO ... XXXX '' in my account. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I called the bank to inquire as to the transfer. I requested a trace number and the representative told me they didn't have one. I was told a claim would be started to find out where the money was ( claim # ending in XXXX ). In the meantime, she said they would refund my account. I was told this would take up to 10 business days. I asked for a trace number but they could not provide one. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX they sent a letter. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I received said letter which said my claim was denied because their \" records didn't show an INCOMING deposit from XXXX PAYMENT TO ... XXXX XXXX  They asked me to verify with the \" sender '' their XXXX digit trace number. \\n\\non XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX pm I spoke with a Capital One rep ( XXXX ID # XXXX ) who did not seem to understand we were referring t an OUTgoing transfer rather than incoming. She finally seemed to understand the situation and said she would update the claim. I asked for a trace number but they could not provide one. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I called again to check on the claim. I spoke with multiple representatives who kept passing me from one department to another. All of them were still under the impression we were talking about an INCOMING transfer. \\n\\nFinally, I was transfered to XXXX in the claims department. XXXX refused to give me her employee ID #. XXXX said the info she had on file was : - XX/XX/XXXX case opened - XX/XX/XXXX case closed - XXXX XXXX case closed again? \\n- XXXX XXXX rebutal submitted after my phone call - XXXX XXXX case closed again, I was never informed. \\n\\nShe said the case was closed again on XX/XX/XXXX because they did not receive enough information. She said the missing information pertained to the trace number on the transaction. I asked again if she had a trace number ; she said no. I asked how I was supposed to provide a trace number for an OUTgoing transfer when they, the OUTgoing bank, did not have it to begin with. She was confused. \\n\\nAt XXXX pm ( one hour into the phone call ) she began opening a new claim ( new claim ending in # XXXX ). She said it would take 45 days to hear back on the new claim. I told her I did not want to wait that long given I have already waited 90 days for my XXXX XXXX dollars to be found. She said she could not expedite it so now I have to wait another month and a half for them to \" investigate '' what happened to the money.   \n",

They have tried purchasing something from XXXX and also was connecting my credit card with an account with chime debt that they have. This is happened to me XXXX different times now and my credit card was never closed after I informed them several times to close the cards. I contacted the XXXX credit bureaus also and it doesnt seem like theyre doing their job either. every time I receive my card in my mailbox they are also receiving other cards in their mailbox under my name so therefore then all the credit cards need to be shut down if they are shut down after calling them several several times to do it.   \n",

I do not have a Capital One account and I am a victim of identity fraud. I called to notify the company that I did not make this change nor open any accounts with them recently. They confirmed that a new account had been opened and referred me to their consumer protection department.   \n",
